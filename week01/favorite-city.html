    <h1>Moscow</h1>

    <p>
        Moscow is my favorite city because it is the capital of Russia and has
        a rich history, impressive architecture, and vibrant cultural life.
        The city blends historic landmarks with modern development, making it
        both educational and exciting to explore.

    <p>
        Some of the most famous places in Moscow include the Kremlin, Red Square,
        and Saint Basils Cathedral. The city also has an extensive public
        transportation system and many museums and theaters.
